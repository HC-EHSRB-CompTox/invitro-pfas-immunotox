## Abstract

Immunotoxicity has emerged as a key health concern for per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with numerous animal studies showing
reduced T-dependent antibody responses (TDAR) and some human
epidemiological studies reporting decreased vaccine antibody titers. In
recent years, many PFAS have been heavily regulated in Canada; however,
with more than 14,000 PFAS and their well-known environmental
persistence, evaluating immunotoxicity for each chemical is critical but
impractical. This highlights the need for efficient, human-relevant test
systems. Here, we assessed immunomodulatory effects of six PFAS
analogues using an ex vivo human peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC) model. PBMCs were pre-exposed to PFAS prior to stimulation to
mimic environmentally relevant exposure scenarios, in which PFAS
exposure precedes an immune challenge. Two immune stimuli were applied,
including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to trigger innate responses and
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to activate T-cell-mediated adaptive pathways.
Multiple endpoints were assessed, including cytokine secretion, T-cell
proliferation, and transcriptomic alterations. This study found that
several PFAS analogues suppressed cytokine secretion and altered T-cell
proliferation to varying degrees following PHA activation.
Transcriptomics results suggest decreased B-cell identity and
immunoglobulin gene expression and increased expression of genes related
to T-cell activation and proliferation. Overall, the human PBMC model
proved to be a cost-effective, ethical, and sensitive new approach
method (NAM) that aligned well with prior in vivo data.
